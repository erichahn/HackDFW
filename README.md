#Project Description Goes Here
Our project incorporates the accesibility of Android with the useability of a custom designed and fabricated Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation, TENS, machine. Through connecting an android device to this TENS machine over an audio cable users are able to selectivly alter the signals that are sent to their muscles to relieve pain.
